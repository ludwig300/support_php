## Setting environment variables

* Create `.env` file in project directory and write:

```
TG_TOKEN=Telegram API token

```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for better isolation.
Python3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
